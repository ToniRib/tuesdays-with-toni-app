      Back when I was in the 1510 backend program, Jeff Casimir challenged us on the last day of mod 1 to think about something we wanted to do differently in mod 2 to help support the community. Since I came from an engineering background and had some prior programming experience, I wanted to give back by helping other students. Here's (a paraphrased version of) how the exchange went:
    </p>
    <p>
      me: "I'd like to help by pairing and mentoring other students more often."<br>
      Jeff: "When?"<br>
      me: "...Tuesdays?"<br>
      Jeff: "What time?"<br>
      me: "4:15pm?"<br>
      Jeff: "Done. I'm putting it on the calendar right now. Tuesdays With Toni!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I continued TWT through my time at Turing but took a break while I was working my first job. When I started at GoSpotCheck in September 2016, I started TWT back up in the same format that I had before: 2 one-on-one sessions on Tuesday, each 45 minutes long, on whatever topic the student wanted.

      As I paired with more and more students across mods 1 - 3 of the backend program, I noticed that I got a lot of the same questions. At the same time, I was gaining more real world development experience and realizing there were certain things that I wish I had more experience in. I started wondering if there was a way that I could supplement some of the school's lessons with my own, using what I had learned as a basis of the lessons.

      Today, Tuesdays With Toni takes the form of once a week lectures that range from 1 - 2 hours based on the content. Jeff came up with the idea for the week six voting process and I thought it was a great way to allow students to have input into their education. My goal is to help students advance their education and to make them even more prepared to get that first junior developer job.
